# CAD Design

## Overview

The automated sunglasses needed to have a way to attach to the hat. In the brainstorming process, we concluded that the best means of fixing the sunglasses to the hat, while maintaining the ability to rotate them, was to create a clip to hold each servo motor to the lid of the hat. In turn, that servo would rotate the glasses when appropriate.

## Design

### V1

[Version 1](ServoMountV1.stl)

Our first design held the servos firmly in place; however, it held them at the wrong angle. After some measuring and a bit of trigonometric math, we calculated that the next version ought to have an angle ~110 degrees. This is about 20 degrees greater than V1's right angle. 

### V2

[Version 2](ServoMountV2.stl)

This version uses the new slanted design. The new angled approach allows the servos to be placed horizontally--inline with the glasses.
